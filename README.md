# In-App Updates Demo
___

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kevintresuelo/InAppUpdatesDemo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kevintresuelo/InAppUpdatesDemo)

This is a demo app for the [In-App Updates API](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/in-app-updates). A similar app with a higher version code is already [published in Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kevintresuelo.tests.updater)

## NOTE
This repo is the source code for the app. For the apk with the same signature as the one uploaded on Google Play, kindly check out the `com.kevintresuelo.tests.updater-10-v1.0.10.apk`.

For the in-app updates to work, the lower version apk should have the same signature as the one uploaded on Google Play.
